          Coded by Kids provides free coding, digital design and computer science education programs
          to children between the ages of 5 and 18 years old. Held in community spaces, including rec
          centers, each weekly program is designed to expose students to the world of technology and
          equip them with the skills to be successful in the tech industry. Our educational philosophy
          emphasizes project-based learning and mentorship, enabling students to develop meaningful
          projects while interacting with experienced industry professionals.

          In addition to free weekly classes, Coded by Kids partners with elementary, middle and high
          schools to provide project based tech education programs to their students. These partnerships
          allow schools to incorporate our education programs into their curriculum, ensuring they are
          teaching the latest technologies and tech industry best practices.
